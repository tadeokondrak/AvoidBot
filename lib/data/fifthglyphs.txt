# What is a fifth glyph?
#
#   The term "fifth glyph" specifically refers to the fifth letter of the Latin
#   alphabet, which may appear in uppercase (E) and lowercase (e) form.  It may
#   be adorned with any number of diacritical marks.  It may also appear as one
#   part of a ligature (Æ).
#
#   Additionally, the fifth glyph is often one of the most frequently-occurring
#   letters within the languages using the Latin alphabet.  Avoiding use of the
#   fifth glyph while writing can be a challenging yet fun exercise.
#
# What about other scripts?
#
#   Currently, there is no official definition for "fifth glyph" as applying to
#   other writing systems.  While the Latin letter E might have a corresponding
#   character in another script, it is not always the fifth letter, nor does it
#   share the same appearance.
#
# What are look-alikes?
#
#   Among various scripts, there are many unrelated characters and symbols that
#   are only visually similar to the Latin letter E.  These "look-alikes" might
#   find use (or abuse) as lazy substitutions for fifth glyphs.
#
# When should look-alikes count as fifth glyphs?
#
#   In the case of look-alikes, intent is ultimately the deciding factor.  If a
#   character or symbol is more likely to be used to bypass detection than used
#   normally, then it should be treated the same as a fifth glyph.
#
#   Given most users will communicate in English, the Greek letter Sigma (Σ) or
#   the Semitic letter Ayin (ع) are not expected to be used often.  To minimize
#   potential abuse, these and other look-alikes will be restricted.
#
# What is NOT a fifth glyph?
#
#   Some look-alikes are exempt from exclusion and may be used.  As an example,
#   the numeral three (3) in the Latin script resembles the Latin letter E only
#   backwards; however, its use is permitted as it is more likely to be used as
#   a numerical digit than as a stand-in for the fifth glyph.
#
#   The Elder Futhark letter *Sōwilō (ᛊ) has two forms, one of which does share
#   a similar appearance to the fifth glyph.  However, its rendering depends on
#   the font used, so it should not be excluded outright.
#
# What about <insert specific character>?
#
#   The current Unicode standard (9.0) contains over 128,000 characters pulling
#   from 135 scripts as well as various symbol sets.  It is not a goal for this
#   document to contain or mention every single look-alike glyph.  Rather, only
#   the most obvious look-alikes should be included.  Consider that the Unicode
#   standard supports combining characters, which could allow construction of a
#   suitable look-alike from otherwise permitted components.  At the end of the
#   day, it is simply not practical to proactively cover every glyph.
#
